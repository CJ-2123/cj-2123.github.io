# Overview

Reverse Rando is a mod that reverses the visits for each world in the game. For example, you will need to complete Land of Dragons 2nd visit (beating Storm Rider) before you can go to Land of Dragons 1st visit (completing missions, mountain climb, Shan Yu, etc.).

This mod allows you to have a completely new experience in the Kingdom Hearts 2 randomizer.

# General World Progression

Generally, the visits for each world are in reverse order, i.e. 2nd visit before 1st visit or in Twilight Town’s case, 3rd visit > 2nd visit > 1st visit.

**There are some special cases:**

- TWTNW world is not reversed, just the bosses.
- Hollow Bastion has special progression:
- HB2 > CoR > Transport to Remembrance > Sephiroth > HB1
- Worlds with Absent Silhouettes require you to beat the Absent Silhouette in between visits
- This applies to Olympus Coliseum, Agrabah, Disney Castle/Timeless River, Halloween Town, and Space Paranoids
- Timeless River is before Disney Castle
- STT days are reversed
- 100 Acre Wood pages are reversed
- Atlantica songs are reversed

**Other notable differences:**

- Proof of Peace is not required to obtain the Mushroom XIII check in Hollow Bastion.
- Data Demyx’s door after HB1 is at Bailey
- AS Marluxia’s portal is in the Hall of the Cornerstone in Disney Castle. Data Marluxia’s portal is in the same spot as regular rando.
- Data Lexaeus’s portal is still in the Peddler’s Shop but he’s poor PayPayLaugh

Some rooms are inaccessible during specific visits. Check the [Missable Chests](#missable-chests) section for treasures that can be missed as a result of this.

<!-- TOC --><a name="battle-levels"></a>

## Battle Levels

Battle levels are swapped between the visits. Adjustments have also been made to the Absent Silhouettes in between visits as well as Cavern of Remembrance and Transport to Remembrance. Absent Silhouettes battle levels will be in between the visits for their respective worlds. CoR and Transport battle levels are between HB1 and HB2’s battle levels.
